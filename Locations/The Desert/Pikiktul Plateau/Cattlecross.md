# Description
Cattlecross is a small ranching town controlled by Hellan located on the Elton River. It is 20 miles from the railroad town of Pasture, and 40 miles downriver of Riverbend.

# History
Cattlecross was founded in 1002 as more people began settling around Cattlecross Ranch. It saw a brief boom and bust in 1017 after a hell shard deposit was found in Bull Skull Cave. Bull Skull Cave was almost completely mined within six months, after which is was boarded up and abandoned. Few demons were ever found in the cave, and it is suspected that the portal had already closed by the time the deposit was found.
