# Description

## About
Hellan is a human-majority country that encompasses the entirety of its namesake island.

## Government
Hellan is a parliamentary constitutional democracy. The head of state is the lord protector, who is elected by the Lower House of parliament. The Lord Protector holds office for five years, with a maximum of two terms in office.

The Lord Protector heads parliament, which consists of the elected Lower House, the appointed Upper House, and The Crown, personified by the reigning monarch. 

The Lower House of parliament is made up of 77 members, which are elected by the land-owning citizens of Hellan. The Lower House elects the Lord Protector, and must vote to approve a bill before it is passed to the Upper House.

The Upper House consists of appointed members of Hellanen noble families. The Upper House receives legislature from the Lower House, and acts to prevent the common citizen from going against the interests of the nobility.

The Crown has ultimate authority in Hellan, although it is very rarely used. All bills must be ratified by The Crown before becoming law of the land, though by convention the reigning monarch almost always signs any bill approved by the Upper House.

### Military
The Armed Forces of Hellan consists of three distinct branches: the Royal Navy, the Hellanen Army, and the newly established Royal Aeronauts.
