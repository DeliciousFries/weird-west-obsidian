Jezebel explains to everyone that she was tasked to find them so they can hunt down Vazirro, a night hag living near Cattlecross.

Best way to Cattlecross is to take the train to Prairie and then walk or ride 20 miles to Cattlecross.

The passenger train will be attacked by demons while en route, and may be derailed if the demons aren't stopped in time.

Passenger train is the engine plus 6 cars. Engine cab is 10x15x10 feet, engine car exterior is 35x15x20 feet, passenger cars are 50x15x10 feet.

Attack led by Bulezau, who brought a bunch of larvae with him.
