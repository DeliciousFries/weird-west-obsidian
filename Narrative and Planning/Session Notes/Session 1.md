#### Opening
Open on wright apartment with Jezebel and Ephraim

Eventually Scrappy, Cain, and Jack show up from market

Jezebel explains to everyone that she was tasked to find them so they can hunt down Vazirro, a night hag living near Cattlecross.

Best way to Cattlecross is to take the train to Prairie and then walk or ride 20 miles to Cattlecross.

#### Train combat
The passenger train will be attacked by demons while en route, and may be derailed if the demons aren't stopped in time.

Passenger train is the engine plus 6 cars. Engine cab is 10x15x10 feet, engine car exterior is 35x15x20 feet, passenger cars are 50x15x10 feet.

Attack led by Bulezau, who brought a bunch of larvae with him.

They will jump onto the top of the train from inside tunnel

Maybe 4 turns until bulezau reaches engine cab, kills the conductor, and throws the explosive larva into the engine boiler

If the party defeat the demons before this happens, they may continue to pasture without incident and receive a reward. Otherwise, the cars derail and combat continues off the moving train. 

#### Path to Cattlecross
Attack by coyote pack lord and 3 coyote warriors

#### Cattlecross
Residents of Cattlecross are uneasy of strangers because they've been haunted by nightmares and strange visions

Residents will know that there used to be an abyss portal in the old bull skull mine.

#### Bull Skull Mine
Room 1 - Corpses of miners and guards litter the floor, a shadow demon wait to ambush the party
Room 2 - this part of the mine swarms with abyssal insects all over the floor, walls, and ceiling. If you step into them they will swarm on you, dealing 1d6 poison damage. They flee fire.
Room 3 - 3 swarms of larvae fill the room, with captured townspeople suspended by their legs from the ceiling
Room 4 - Night hag lair. She will be incapacitated when found, and during her turn she will cast etherealness and run away.
