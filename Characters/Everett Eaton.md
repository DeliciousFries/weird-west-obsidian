# About Everett Eaton
Everett Eaton is the elected town marshal of [[Cattlecross]]. He has served as the town marshal since mid 1022, when he moved to town. He has served as a marshal in three other towns. He has no family.

# History
Eaton used to be a highwayman who ran with a small gang before they were caught by the law. Eaton's three compatriots were all hung, but Eaton was approached by the devil Vezos who offered him a deal. If Eaton kill innocents for Vezos when called upon, Vezos would free him from prison and give him a new life.

# Appearance
Everett Eaton is a human male of about 5'10". He has a pale complexion, short-cropped brown hair that he covers with a wide-brimmed hat, and a small moustache. He appears to be in his late 30s.
