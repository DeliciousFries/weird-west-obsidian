# Background
In 943, researchers at Kinghill University in Keld, Hellan discovered a method of opening permanent portals to the abyss. In their following research, they discovered that in proximity to the portal, magical energy escaping the abyss solidified into crystals known as [[Hell shards]]. Around the time this happened, Yatoran spies imbedded at Kinghill University leaked this information to Yatoran researchers. Both nations quickly discovered industrial and military applications  for the new energy source.

# Description
The Openings refers to the opening of a many large abyss portals by both Hellanen and Yatoran mages in the mostly uninhabited desert region in late 1005. Their goal was to create large-scale harvesting efforts for Hell shards.

Shortly after the opening of portals near Hellanen-controlled Ubris and Yatoran Mizumi, demons swarmed out of the portals and took control of the area. Both nations quickly reclaimed the land and closed the portals, but the demon invasion had expanded the reach of the portals to the vast cave networks that lie under the Desert.

# Aftermath
While the Opening was a disaster for the two cities which it saw nearly demolished, Prospectors quickly realized the economic implications of the portals stretching out through such a vast expanse of land. Hell shards were solidifying in the ground in various regions all throughout the desert. 

This launched an industry throughout the desert where explorers would find hell shard deposits, miners would set up a temporary town, and mercenaries would be hired to fight off demons until the hell shard deposit was mined clean.

The Influx of hell shards caused a still-ongoing technological revolution called the [[Abyssal Revolution]].
