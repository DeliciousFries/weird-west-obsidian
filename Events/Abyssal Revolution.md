# Background
In late 1005, [[The Opening]] caused a large amount of hell shards to solidify in the desert. This led to large-scale extraction efforts. The influx of hell shards allowed for much more technological experimentation than previously possible.

# Description
The two major research centers of the two great nations, Kinghill University, Hellan, and Shibiro University quickly began developing new technology powered by the magic-infused hell shards.

# Important Technological Developments
#### Hell Engine - 1008
Hell engines were invented in 1007 in Yatoro. They were a significant advancement on the commonly used steam engine, as they were much smaller, and capable of generating more energy. Hell engines paved the way for more technological advancement

#### Dirigible Airship - 1009
The relatively small size of the Hell Engine allowed for the creation of airships with engines. This further increased the amount of hell shards that could be gathered because airships could be used to bypass all non-flying demons.

#### Ornithopter - 1011
This much smaller flying machine can typically seat one or two people. They have a fairly short flight range, and can't handle poor weather, but they make fantastic vehicles for intracity travel and for courier service between neighboring towns.

#### Life Making - 1015
Researchers discovered that hell shards could simulate consciousness if they were externally powered. This led to some ethically dubious scientific advancements.

#### Thought Processors - 1015
The first discovered use of hell shard sentience were thought processors, which could be telepathically linked with to store and process information.

#### Automata - 1016
By attaching hell shard thought processors to automata bodies, fully autonomous and sentient automata started to be created. At first, these were mostly used for menial tasks, as they had low intelligence.

#### Warforged - 1020
With the advent of the War of Disarmament, both the Hellanen and Yatoran militaries started the creation of automata soldiers. Prototypes were first built in 1020, with varying levels of intelligence and individuality. The final version that is still in use today was built in 1022. Warforged are generally powered by hell shards, but some are powered by internal combustion engines.

#### War Machines - 1025
War Machines are semi-sentient automata built for the battlefield. They are built using hell shards and human brains to form a complex computing ability. They are powered by many hell shards, and need much more often than the much smaller automata. War machines vary in size, but they commonly range from 8 to 15 feet tall. There are also much larger war machines, with both Yatoro and Hellan developing some that are as large as 100 feet tall.
