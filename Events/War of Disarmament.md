# Background
Tensions have always been high between neighboring imperial superpowers Hellan and Yatoro. Following [[the Opening]], and the subsequent hell shard rush, tensions grew as their were minor disputes over territory. 

# Description
The War of Disarmament began as a cold war between Hellan and Yatoro. During the early rush for hell shards, both nations began building up their armies and researching new technologies to wage war. The war remained cold, though tensions continued to rise, until the sixth month of 1020 when a Hellanen regiment marched into Moto Moto in search of a large hell shard deposit rumored to within the wetland. Moto Moto, which was a protectorate of Yatoro, called on Yatoro for assistance. Yatoro declared war on Hellan on the fourth.

The advent of a hot war quickly turned the economy of both nations even more towards weapons development, which kickstarted the warforged and war machine projects. Both nations withdrew their military presence from demon strongholds throughout the desert as they needed people to fight in the war. This opened up more demand for freelance demon hunters.

Both nations are naval empires, so most fighting has been by sea. There has also been fighting throughout the southern coast of the Desert.
