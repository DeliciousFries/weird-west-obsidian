Generally, technology is:
- Knowledge being applied toward material goals.
- In a reproducible manner.
- Via use of tangible tools such as hammers, gears, factories, etc.
- Or via use of intangible tools, such as standard practice, processes, or other similar knowledge-oriented methods.

This can include anything from consistent use of fire and firemaking methods, to tool-making, all the way to the creation of computers or AI.
